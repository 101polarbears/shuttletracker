    <h2>Spring 2020 Route Changes</h2>
    <h3>The Changes</h3>
    <p>Starting January 2020 the current East and West route system will be changed to include three routes: North, South, and West. An image of the new routes is shown below. The new routes can additionally be viewed on the Tracker by toggling them in the /settings page.</p>

    <p>All Shuttle hours will remain the same. These route changes will be occurring only apply for Weekdays, the current East and West routes will remain on Weekends.</p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The overall goal of these changes was to reduce shuttle loop time, remove underutilized stops, and add stops where there is current demand. Some things to note about the changes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All routes will move clockwise</li>
      <li>Blitman Commons stop is moving to the bus shelter on 6th Ave</li>
      <li>The City Station stop is moving across the street to City Station East</li>
      <li>North and South shuttles will both stop at B-lot and LXA</li>
      <li>South and West shuttles will both stop at the Off Campus Commons</li>
      <li>North and West shuttles will both stop at the new Ricketts stop</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Credit</h3>
    <p>These changes were designed and proposed by the Facilities and Services Committee of the Student Senate in collaboration with Parking and Transportation. Thank you to all members of FSC for their work over the past several months and to Parking and Transportation for being extremely receptive to feedback and very willing to make these changes.</p>
